# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

#User.create!({first_name: "Админ", second_name: "Админов", patronymic: "Админович", email: "admin@gmail.ru", phone: "+79111111112", password: "password", password_confirmation: "password", role: 2})
